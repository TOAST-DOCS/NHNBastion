## Security > NHN Bastion > Overview


NHN Bastion is a server access control service for secure access to infrastructure assets used for instances on NHN Cloud.


### Main Features


* Allows you to control SSH access to your instance, and register commands to allow and block.

* Provides a history of instance access and command usage, and you can back up the history to Object Storage.

* Provides a variety of instance authentication methods, including SSH keys, passwords, and temporary SSH keys.

* Provides a browser-based SSH experience to easily connect to your instances.

* Reflects instances that are created or deleted automatically as service targets.

* Provides real-time monitoring and session blocking.


### Feature Description


#### Connect Instances


* Displays only the instances you can currently access based on the access control policies granted to you.

* Provides three access methods - SSH key, password, and temporary SSH key - so you can use the authentication method that fits your environment.

* When you enable the auto-registration feature, all instances within the project are registered, and changes to the instances are automatically reflected.

* You can register external resources from other projects and legacy environments. However, connecting instances requires a connected network environment, such as peering.
