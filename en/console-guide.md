## Security > NHN Bastion > Console User Guide
NHN Bastion allows you to control access to instances on NHN Cloud. This document describes how to create an NHN Bastion in the NHN Cloud console, connect it to the instances you need access to, and manage users and their policies, resources, and history.
### Get Started

1. To use NHN Bastion, the first step is to enable the NHN Bastion service.
2. NHN Bastion requires permission to access your resources through API connections to provide services.

### Create an NHN Bastion

1. Go to **Security > NHN Bastion**.
2. Set each item and click **Create Instance** at the bottom.
    * **Name**(required): A name to distinguish between web terminals if you use multiple web terminals.
    * **Type**(required): Instance performance of the web terminal.
        * Performance refers to the number of SSH sessions a web terminal can create simultaneously
    * **VPC**(required): The VPC to use for the web terminal.
    * **Subnet**(required): The subnet to use for the web terminal.
    * **Floating IP**(optional): Whether to use a floating IP for the web terminal.

> [Note]
> * The first web terminal created can't change or delete its specs until the service is deactivated.
> * You can only connect a floating IP to a VPC that has an Internet gateway connected.
> * The web terminal must allow SSH communication with the access target in order to access the access target (e.g., Security Groups, etc.).

### Connecte Instances

In <strong>Manage Policies</strong>, users only see a list of instances they are allowed to access, and they can access the instances they are allowed to access.

#### Access Instances

1. On the instance you need access to, click **Connect**.
2. Select the web terminal you want to use to access your instance.
3. If there are multiple IPs of instances to access, select the IPs that are accessible.
4. Select an authentication method.
    * SSH key authentication
        * Enter the operating system account for the instance.
        * Upload the key you set when you created the instance.
    * Password authentication
        * Enter the operating system account for the instance.
        * Enter the password for the instance.
    * Authenticate with a temporary SSH key
        * Enter the operating system account for the instance.

> [Caution]
> * You need to select a web terminal that can SSH communicate with your instance.
> * Password authentication requires the operating system to enable password access.
> * Temporary SSH key authentication is only accessible through the web terminal from which you copied the script.

### Manage Users

You can view a list of users authorized to use the NHN Bastion service and create and manage user groups.

#### User List

You can set access control policies and command control policies for instances enrolled in the connection target.
Each policy has a priority, and policies are applied in order of highest priority.

[Example]
If the policy is applied as shown in the [table] below,
* user A can access Instance A, only the `shutdown` command is unavailable, other commands are available
* user A can access Instance B, only the `cd` command is available, no other commands
* user B can access Instance A, only the `reboot` command is unavailable, other commands are available
* user B cannot access Instance B

| Priority | User | Access Target | Command Policy |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ------ |
| #1 | user A | Instance A | [Deny] shutdown |
| #2 | user A | Instance A, Instance B | [Allow] cd |
| #3 | user B | Instance A | [Deny] reboot |

#### Create a policy

    * **Deny**: Using registered commands is blocked (blacklisting method).


> [Caution]
The following commands are blocked regardless of whether you have a command policy enrollment.
> * Bypass blocking commands: SSH, TELNET, SFTP, RCP, SCP, FTP, RSAP, RLOGIN, etc.
