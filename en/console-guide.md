## Security > NHN Bastion > Console User Guide
NHN Bastion allows you to control access to instances on NHN Cloud. This document describes how to create an NHN Bastion in the NHN Cloud console, connect it to the instances you need access to, and manage users and their policies, resources, and history.
### Get Started

1. To use NHN Bastion, the first step is to enable the NHN Bastion service.
2. NHN Bastion requires permission to access your resources through API connections to provide services.

### Create an NHN Bastion
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdcf129e-996a-44b1-8c17-09f4cddf9008)

1. Go to **Security > NHN Bastion**.
2. Set each item and click **Create Instance** at the bottom.
    * **Name**(required): A name to distinguish between web terminals if you use multiple web terminals.
    * **Availability** zone (required): Availability zone to use in the web terminal.
    * **Type**(required): Instance performance of the web terminal.
        * Performance refers to the number of SSH sessions a web terminal can create simultaneously
    * **VPC**(required): The VPC to use for the web terminal.
    * **Subnet**(required): The subnet to use for the web terminal.
    * **Floating IP**(required): Whether to use a floating IP for the web terminal.
    * **Encryption**(required): Whether to store logs encrypted or not
        * Symmetric key ID: The symmetric key ID managed by the Secure Key Manager service.
        * To set up encryption, you must generate a symmetric key in the Secure Key Manager service beforehand.

> [Note]
> * The first web terminal created can't change or delete its specs until the service is deactivated.
> * You can only connect a floating IP to a VPC that has an Internet gateway connected.
> * The web terminal must allow SSH communication with the access target in order to access the access target (e.g., Security Groups, etc.).
> * Log encryption for: user ID, email, commands

> [Caution]
> * If the Secure Key Manager service rotates the symmetric key you set up for log encryption, you need to be careful not to immediately delete the old version of the key.
> * If you delete the symmetric key that you set for log encryption in the Secure Key Manager service, the encrypted logs cannot be decrypted. You must manage the symmetric key carefully to avoid accidentally deleting it.

### Connecting instances

In <strong>Manage Policies</strong>, users only see a list of instances they are allowed to access, and they can access the instances they are allowed to access.

#### Accessing instances

1. On the instance you need access to, click **Connect**.
2. Select the web terminal you want to use to access your instance.
3. If there are multiple IPs of instances to access, select the IPs that are accessible.
4. Select an authentication method.
    * SSH key authentication
        * Enter the operating system account for the instance.
        * Upload the key you set when you created the instance.
    * Password authentication
        * Enter the operating system account for the instance.
        * Enter the password for the instance.
    * Authenticate with a temporary SSH key
        * Enter the operating system account for the instance.

> [Caution]
> * You need to select a web terminal that can SSH communicate with your instance.
> * Password authentication requires the operating system to enable password access.
> * Temporary SSH key authentication is only accessible through the web terminal from which you copied the script.

### Manage Users

You can view a list of users authorized to use the NHN Bastion service and create and manage user groups.

#### User list

### Manage Policies
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a3683bb-5661-4867-83a6-6a8ae795116f)

You can set access control policies and command control policies for instances enrolled in the connection target.
Each policy has a priority, and policies are applied in order of highest priority.

[Example]
If the policy is applied as shown in the [table] below,
* user A can access Instance A, only the `shutdown` command is unavailable, other commands are available
* user A can access Instance B, only the `cd` command is available, no other commands
* user B can access Instance A, only the `reboot` command is unavailable, other commands are available
* user B cannot access Instance B

| Priority | User | Access Target | Command Policy |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ------ |
| #1 | user A | Instance A | [Deny] shutdown |
| #2 | user A | Instance A, Instance B | [Allow] cd |
| #3 | user B | Instance A | [Deny] reboot |

#### Create a policy

> [Note]
> When log encryption is enabled, logs are decrypted and backed up to Object Storage.
> Logs are backed up to Object Storage from the time you set up the backup. Previously saved logs are not backed up.

> [Caution]
> Object Storage backups in other regions are not supported if the VPC where the web terminal was initially created does not have an Internet gateway.

#### Manage Connection Ports

You can specify the SSH port used to access the instance.

> [Note]
> The port used to connect from the web terminal to the instance being accessed, which must be set to the SSH port set by your operating system.

If you performed key rotation in Secure Key Manager, you can update an older version of the key to the latest version via the Rotate key button.

> [Caution]
> If you do not update the key in the NHN Bastion service after performing key rotation in Secure Key Manager, an error might occur in the log inquiry.

#### Delete NHN Bastion

Delete all resources created by the NHN Bastion service.

> [Caution]
> Data created while using the NHN Bastion service and all resources within the service will be deleted, and information cannot be recovered once deleted.


### Web Terminal

#### Transfer Files
You can launch the file navigator by clicking the right arrow button. The file navigator allows you to upload or download files with the desired path.
You can adjust the font size by clicking the right arrow button.

>[Note]
> File transfer is based on the permissions of the operating system account that was initially accessed, and account changes via the su command are not reflected.
> If you upload files by dragging and dropping, they are saved in your home directory, regardless of the current directory path.
